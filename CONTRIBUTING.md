   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üé® Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods

```typescript
/**
 * Finds the most expensive item in the current category
 * @returns Promise<void>
 */
async findLuxuryItem(): Promise<void> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Page Object Model

- Follow the existing POM structure
- Use descriptive locator names
- Implement proper error handling
- Add wait strategies for dynamic content

```typescript
export class NewPage extends BasePage {
  readonly elementLocator = this.page.locator('selector');
  
  async performAction(): Promise<void> {
    await this.elementLocator.click();
  }
}
```

### Test Structure

- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the Given-When-Then pattern
- Add appropriate test tags (@smoke, @regression)
- Include proper assertions

```typescript
test('should complete checkout flow successfully @smoke', async ({ page }) => {
  // Given: User is on the homepage
  const home = new DemoblazeHomePage(page);
  await home.navigate();
  
  // When: User adds item and checks out
  await home.findLuxuryItem();
  
  // Then: Order should be confirmed
  await expect(page.locator('text=Thank you')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories

- **@smoke**: Critical functionality tests (fast, essential)
- **@regression**: Full regression test suite (comprehensive)
- **@mobile**: Mobile-specific tests
- **@api**: API testing (if applicable)

### Test Data Management

- Use JSON files in `tests/data/` for test data
- Keep test data separate from test logic
- Use meaningful data that represents real scenarios

### Error Handling

- Implement robust error handling
- Use appropriate timeouts
- Handle network issues gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages

## üìö Documentation Standards

### README Updates

- Update README.md for new features
- Include usage examples
- Update installation instructions if needed

### Code Comments

- Comment complex logic
- Explain business rules
- Document API interactions
- Include TODO comments for future improvements

### Documentation Files

- Keep documentation up to date
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add screenshots for UI changes

## üîç Code Review Process

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Clear Description**
   - Describe what the PR does
   - Explain why the change is needed
   - Reference related issues

2. **Small, Focused Changes**
   - Keep PRs focused on a single feature/fix
   - Avoid large, complex changes
   - Break down large features into smaller PRs

3. **Testing**
   - Include tests for new functionality
   - Ensure all existing tests pass
   - Test on multiple browsers if applicable

4. **Documentation**
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Add comments for complex code
   - Update README if needed
